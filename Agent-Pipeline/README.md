# Agent Pipeline

This folder contains only the agent orchestration code for the AI-Calling-Agent project.

- `agent.py`: Main orchestrator for running data ingestion, RAG, and direct LLM answers using Gemini API.
- `.keep`: Ensures the folder is tracked by git.

All other pipeline code (RAG, ingestion, etc.) should be kept in their respective folders/branches.
