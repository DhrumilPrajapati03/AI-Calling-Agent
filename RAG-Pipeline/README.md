# RAG Pipeline

This folder contains only the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) code for the AI-Calling-Agent project.

- `rag_query.py`: Retrieves relevant context from the knowledge base for a user query.
- `.keep`: Ensures the folder is tracked by git.

All agent orchestration and ingestion code should be kept in their respective folders/branches.
